# Slagalica
A small terminal application that let's you play 3 of the games from a popular Serbian quiz show called "Slagalica".
The games you can play are "Ko zna zna", "Skocko" and "Spojnice".

## Details
- Terminal GUI built with "curses".
- Also includes a scraping script that uses "Selenium" to collect data for the "Spojnice" game from "slagalica.tv".

## Known issues
- Only works on Linux (Mac not tested) because of the "curses" module.
